# Track 04 / Phase 1 / Task 01

## Completion and evidence contract

- This issue mirrors one top-level checklist item in the Conductor plan.
- Nested checklist entries remain acceptance details inside this issue.
- Closing a source-complete task does not promote the parent track's evidence level.
- Reopening or closing is synchronised only from the canonical Conductor checklist.
- Higher-evidence, downstream, human and registry gates require their own receipts.
